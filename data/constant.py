# row anchors are a series of pre-defined coordinates in image height to detect lanes
# the row anchors are defined according to the evaluation protocol of CULane and Tusimple
# since our method will resize the image to 288x800 for training, the row anchors are defined with the height of 288
# you can modify these row anchors according to your training image resolution
